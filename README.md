[TypeNexus](https://www.npmjs.com/package/typenexus) is a great tool for API encapsulation and management. It offers a clean and lightweight way to bundle [TypeORM](https://github.com/typeorm/typeorm) + [Express.js](https://github.com/expressjs/express) functionality, helping you to build applications faster while reducing template code redundancy and type conversion work.

```bash
npm run watch # Listen compile .ts files.
npm run build # compile .ts files.

npm run dev
npm run start
```
